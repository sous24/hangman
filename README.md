# Hangman Project

## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## About the Project
This project aims to create an easy code base for the game, hangman. It is built using Python.

## Installation Instructions
Install Python 3 
Copy and paste code from "milestone_5.py" file

## Usage Instructions
The player must input a letter/guess. The display will prompt for more inputs if the guess is correct, if not, the player will lose a life and has to try again.

## What I learnt from the Project
I learnt how to implement a class and use it to organise a demo of a game.
I used basics of python programming language as well as principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to make the game play effective.
